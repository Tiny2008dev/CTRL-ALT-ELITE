Title: Smart Alumni Connect – Integrated Web & Mobile Alumni Engagement Platform
Background:
Colleges often struggle to maintain strong and continuous engagement with their alumni due
to the lack of a centralized digital platform. Alumni interactions are typically handled through
scattered communication channels such as emails, messaging groups, or manual records. This
results in limited networking, reduced participation in institutional activities, and missed
opportunities for mentorship, career support, and fundraising. There is a need for a unified,
scalable, and user-friendly platform that enables alumni, students, and the institution to stay
connected through a single web and mobile ecosystem.
Challenge:
Design and develop a comprehensive Alumni Association platform that integrates key
features such as registration, networking, job opportunities, event management, and
donation support. The solution should be accessible via web and/or mobile and should
provide a seamless and secure experience for alumni, administrators, and students. Teams are
expected to build a working prototype within 24 hours that demonstrates core functionalities
and a scalable system design.
Create a centralized digital platform that strengthens engagement, communication, and
collaboration between alumni and the institution.
Demonstrate originality and forward-thinking through inventive ideas and creative
solutions
